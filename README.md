# 👋 Hi there, it's Sapphire!
I am just a teen who loves programming in so many coding languages, I used to code in C only, but I started learning new coding languages like C#, VBS, Batchfile, etc etc, Ever since I was a child, I had a weird obsession with Microsoft Windows and computer viruses as a whole. I may have the most shit code, but at least it works for all I care.
